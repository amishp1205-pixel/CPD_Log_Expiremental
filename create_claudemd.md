Create a CLAUDE.md file with the following headings:
1. Project goals
2. Architecture overview
3. Design, style, UX guides
4. Constraints and policies
5. Repo / git etiquette
6. Frequently used commands
7. Testing instructions

Use the project_spec.md doc as a starting point.

Link out to other docs where possible, for example the docs/architecture.md and the docs/changelog.md files.

User the AskUserQuestionTool to interview me to get the neccessary information in order to populate the Claude.md.

Add a section to the CLAUDE.md file to remind Claude to update the CLAUDE.md as needed after major changes, new features added, or project milestones reached.
